# Python Data Storage
## About this Project
This repo contains exercises related to Python lists, dictionaries and tuples. So far, the repo contains the following exercises:
- Counting unique words in a text file
- Count the frequently most emails received from, as well as the day and hour, in an mbox

The Python files include comments that provide dialog on how the programs work and what they do. The text files are included in the repo to allow anyone forking the repo to run the Python program.
